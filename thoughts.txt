video is either:
- recorded
- streamed

basically always of me in the shower
i manually record on my phone all of the actual good stuff to be sold directly or via message
if i recorded locally on a gopro while doing the above with a phone i could get two potential view sales from one
- i could sell the gopro video as an edited teaser of a full video for 3-5x the price
how would i want to automatically edit that teaser file from the gopro?
- i don't want to show the end
- i probably don't want the beginning
-> i probably want a random short segment near the end
and that would include in the message that the full video 

well what's the point between posting to buy and just sending the video as a message cod
really every good video should be mass messaged to max the spending potential for it but i really don't want to spam 2 messages for sale of the same set in a row in a day and this level isn't worth dragging out longer than a day of tease
-> so i should post the teaser and mass message the good video

so
i want to do some video editing operations:
- save complete untouched copy as backup
- remove first 1-2 minutes of video
- archive backup

i want to label the file by who i'm showering with before I shower:
- default: myself
- enter: screen_names separated by commas

i want to sort the file by what i did in the shower after the shower:
- the action is applied to the title of the video so that the filename is used as text when uploading to OnlyFans automatically
- 


i can maybe pre set metadata for the file to be then read by the server to interpret as commands to edit, tweet, etc







this records / streams from a GoPro without need of an sd card
however,
phone recording > gopro

so the gopro footage is rather unnecessary and extra

there's no reason to use it for teaser footage cause the camera footage can be edited for that anyways and still be better by default

it requires an rpi and a laptop to run
which is no big deal, but i could free up the rpi3
and not bother bringing my laptop into the bathroom and just record/stream from my phone
unless i want my laptop to play music at the same time which is nbg

so this project's ultimate purpose is rather pointless
the gopro overheats too easily to just use it to randomly stream
the footage still needs to be tuned to be as good as a camera
i don't need the website to sell clips of bad shower footage when i have onlyfans

i could use the site as a backup source for providing my own material
i should push the project towards being more of a backup for simply purchasing content from me

so, say, i have a general repo of stuff that i think is worth being purchased as a video file or collection of images

deeznuts can provide a structured way for fans to purchase specific content from me at any time regardless of onlyfans being up

the site already has the basic structure to act as a streaming source for people to log into. I should add all the typical live cam features to it as preparation for the final sheelasites

so really i need to restructure this to be more of a concerted personal site effort and also update my linkz.tree copy thing to be more mobile friendly and hide my projects better

I could provide all the shower videos in their own category for free, and delete the oldest ones to maintain a low server presence
